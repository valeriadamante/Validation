# Validation
This is a repository for DQM and Validation scripts

Changes to be done to the make_histogram script: 
- Add Cms plotting style (simulation / phase 2 ) -> substitute "preliminary" with "simulation", blank for lumi and and sqrt(s) = 14TeV
- Change the name of histo to include the layer name "cluster _ Barrel _layer1 " and put in the same directory, 
- the substructure will be: TOP - (IT / OT ) - (digi/ rechit/ cluster) - histograms
